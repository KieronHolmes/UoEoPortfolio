    "type": "Core",
    "description": "This module provides a practical foundation in research methods that enables students to conduct research in practical settings. The approach covers various tools and techniques that a researcher may deploy and facilitates continual feedback throughout the module through cases and project tasks. The selected textbook offers a comprehensive redress of the subject, based around the scientific method and offering much details for doing research in various type of organisations. Students will be able to identify with research practicalities no matter their background, as well as use critical analysis of the key principles of research methodology in bringing together the knowledge gained throughout other modules on the programme. The module will also highlight professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues related to computing projects, as well as the applicable codes of ethics and practice. The module uses continuous assessment throughout with weekly case studies and milestone assessments, hence facilitating peerto-peer as well as instructor interactions. Students will demonstrate their ability and strengths through evidence and reflections by maintaining an e-portfolio."

    "type": "Core",
    "description": "This module provides students with a systematic method for planning, executing, writing, and defending a dissertation for a research project on a selected topic of interest. The student will undertake a substantive piece of independent work designed to demonstrate her/his ability to manage the learning process and achieve successful milestones and targets. Emphasis will be on developing skills in planning, writing, ethics, investigation, interpretation, evaluation, and critical thinking. The projectâ€™s topic will be agreed with a designated dissertation supervisor prior to commencement to ensure feasibility within the timeframe of the module. It should be noted that the topic of the literature review produced during the Research Methods and Professional Issues module, cannot be used in this Dissertation and Project module. This must be a separate project."
