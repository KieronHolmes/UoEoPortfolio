                I am Kieron Holmes. A developer based in the small town of Hastings in the South East of England, working for a small local authority.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                I develop primarily in PHP, with Laravel being my Framework of choice, combined with a multitude of other utilities, some of which include Vue.js, Inertia.js and the Azure Devops suite for CI/CD.
                I have a working understanding of many other languages/tools, some of which include SQL (MySQL, MS-SQL, PostGres, Ingres), Python, Node.JS and Jekyll.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                I have recently enrolled onto the University of Essex Online's MSc Computer Science Course.
                I hope this course helps build on my current experiences, providing me with a wealth of knowledge, with an academic basis to help future career progression.
            </p>
