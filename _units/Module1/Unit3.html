    <h2 class="text-2xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold text-indigo-900">Learning Objectives</h2>
    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4">
        <ul style="list-style: disc">
            <li>Appreciate the emerging trend of computing that led to the advancement of human computer interaction.</li>
            <li>Identify the fundamental technologies that are deployed to support the emerging computing technologies.</li>
            <li>Identify the risks and threats associated with emerging technology and suggest guidelines to mitigate those risks.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold text-indigo-900">Artificial Intelligence Tools (Google)</h2>
    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4">
        Google produce a series of Artificial Intelligence tools, which are released to the public for implementation into their own solutions, for research purposes, or open-source developments. Their main software package is TensorFlow, which provides developers with the opportunity to create neural networks, image classifiers and much more.

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold text-indigo-900">Google Translate</h2>
    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4">
        Google Translate is an online platform for both visibly translating from one language to another, as well as providing audible translations. This package initially used English as an intermediary language, with the results being accurate only in the literal sense, not accounting for differences in local dialect or 'slang'.<br><br>The service has since evolved to make use of the advancements with the Artificial Neural Network software packages, identifying the similarities between languages, as well as structuring a sentence in the same way a native speaker would. Users are given the ability to rate the translation they receive, noting any corrections they would make. Once verified, changes would be pushed to the classification models, resulting in a more accurate translation for future users of the service.
