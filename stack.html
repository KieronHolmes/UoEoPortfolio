                This site was developed using a combination of the following languages and utilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">HTML & CSS</span></li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</span></li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Jekyll: </span>Jekyll was chosen as the static site generator tool of choice, as it allows me to use the Liquid templating engine to rapidly generate pages and add to this site.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Github: </span>This was chosen due to the widespread usage, as well as student benefits exceeding that of any other repository management tool.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Github Pages: </span> Github Pages was used as a hosting tool for serving up the static pages generated by Jekyll and Travis CI. It provides a free hosting service, with the ability to use SSL and custom domains.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Travis CI: </span>Travis CI was chosen as the build-management tool of choice for this project, as Github Pages doesn't support a series of Jekyll plugins which may be needed at a later development stage.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Dependabot: </span>Dependabot was enabled on deployment to ensure that all dependencies (Within Gemfile.lock) are kept updated.</li>
            </ul>
