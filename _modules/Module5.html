This module introduces students to the underpinning concepts
and skills of Software Engineering Project Management, as well
as introducing concepts of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
This includes both the traditional tools of project management
including estimating, planning and scheduling, as well as those
of software architecture and engineering disciplines. The module
describes requirements management, SDLC approaches, including
continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), as well as
tools often delivered as part of the Agile methodology. Students
will be introduced to the techniques in an engaging format, using a
mixture of group work and individual activities.
