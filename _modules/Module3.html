This module introduces students to the underpinning concepts
and skills of Secure Software Development. This includes a review
of traditional and contemporary Software Development LifeCycle
(SDLC)models, focusing in particular on the areas most affected
by secure coding considerations. The course will provide students
with a combination of an understanding of security principles
together with exposure to automated testing tools. Students will
be introduced to the techniques in an engaging format, using a
mixture of practical exercises, group work and individual activities.
