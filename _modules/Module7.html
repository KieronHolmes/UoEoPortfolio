This module provides students with a systematic method for
planning, executing, writing, and defending a dissertation for a
research project on a selected topic of interest.
The student will undertake a substantive piece of independent
work designed to demonstrate her/his ability to manage the
learning process and achieve successful milestones and targets.
Emphasis will be on developing skills in planning, writing, ethics,
investigation, interpretation, evaluation, and critical thinking.
The projectâ€™s topic will be agreed with a designated dissertation
supervisor prior to commencement to ensure feasibility within
the timeframe of the module. It should be noted that the topic of
the literature review produced during the Research Methods and
Professional Issues module, cannot be used in this Dissertation
and Project module. This must be a separate project.
