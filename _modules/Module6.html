This module provides a practical foundation in research methods
that enables students to conduct research in practical settings. The
approach covers various tools and techniques that a researcher
may deploy and facilitates continual feedback throughout the
module through cases and project tasks.
The selected textbook offers a comprehensive redress of the
subject, based around the scientific method and offering much
details for doing research in various type of organisations. Students
will be able to identify with research practicalities no matter their
background, as well as use critical analysis of the key principles of
research methodology in bringing together the knowledge gained
throughout other modules on the programme. The module will
also highlight professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues
related to computing projects, as well as the applicable codes of
ethics and practice.
The module uses continuous assessment throughout with weekly
case studies and milestone assessments, hence facilitating peerto-peer as well as instructor interactions. Students will demonstrate
their ability and strengths through evidence and reflections by
maintaining an e-portfolio.
